    "executiveSummary": "This week’s operations focused on site calibration and the commencem ent of drilling. Early in the week, the team identified a site alignment discrepancy during GPS calibration, traced to an invalid RPLS control mark. Corey spearheaded the resolution, coordinating with our surveying contractor to rectify the control data. This allowed the crew to successfully re-stake the alignment by Tuesday.\n\nFollowing these adjustments, we completed potholing for six vault low spots and received necessary materials for a construction entrance. The drilling crew mobilized mid-week, successfully completing all sump locations—including a field-directed addition at SB-12—and installing all required screen and tee components.  ",

All excavations will be conducted in strict accordance with OSHA standards, requiring that a designated competent person inspects and signs off on trenches daily before any crew entry. With snow and ice in the forecast, the team must maintain heightened awareness regarding slip, trip, and fall hazards. Particular attention must be paid to footing around trench edges and maintaining clear, stable access points despite the deteriorating weather conditions.",

    "weeklyTopicNotes": "Line of fire is any position where you could be struck, caught, or crushed if something moves unexpectedly. It sounds simple, but these are the kinds of hazards that don’t always give you a second chance.  Think about a few examples:\n- Reaching under a suspended load because you think it’s steady.\n- Standing between a truck and a piece of equipment during backing.\n- Putting your hands between\nIn the moment, those things can feel small, but all it takes is one shift, one slip, or one movement, and you’re in harm’s way.  A lot of line of fire incidents happen not because people don’t know better, but because they’re focused on getting the job done. And that’s exactly why we’ve got to slow down, look around, and ask ourselves: If something moves right now, where am I going to be?\nThat quick question can save you from a life-changing injury.A\nt the end of the day, no task is worth putting yourself in the line of fire. Take the extra step. Step back, reposition, and think before you act. Because the best way to survive a line of fire hazards is to not be in it at all."
